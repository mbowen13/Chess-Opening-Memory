# ChessOpeningsJS - Javascript Interactive Chess Openings
---
## What is ChessOpeningsJS?
*It's like interactive flashcards for chess openings.*

Features:
- Create your own openings with the interactive chess board. 
- Create a deck (like a flashcard deck) of chess openings that you want to memorize.

Note:
- jQuery manipulates the DOM, which does not integrate well with modern Front-end frameworks. Keep that in mind if you wish to extend this into an SPA
- All data is persisted locally on the client, which is not great for data persistence. If you want to extend this MVP, contemplate using a BaaS like FireBase or create a backend to persist data in a database.
